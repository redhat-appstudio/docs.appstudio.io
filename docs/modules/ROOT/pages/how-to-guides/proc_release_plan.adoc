= Creating a `ReleasePlan` object

The development team creates a `ReleasePlan` object in the developer workspace. The `ReleasePlan` object includes a reference to the application that the development team wants to release, along with workspace where the application is supposed to be released.

.*Prerequisites*

* You have an existing Development workspace.
* Ensure you have installed `oc`.
* You have completed the steps listed in the link:https://redhat-appstudio.github.io/docs.appstudio.io/Documentation/main/getting-started/getting_started_in_cli/[Getting started in the CLI] page.

.*Procedures*

. Create a `ReleasePlan.yaml` object locally.

+
*Example `ReleasePlan.yaml` object*

+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: appstudio.redhat.com/v1alpha1
kind: ReleasePlan
metadata:
 labels:
   release.appstudio.openshift.io/auto-release: 'true'
 name: sre-production <.>
 namespace: dev-workspace <.>
spec:
 application: demo-app <.>
 data: <key> <.>
 pipelineRef: <pipeline_ref> <.>
 serviceAccount:  <service-account> <.>
 target: managed-workspace <.>
----

+
<.> The name of the release plan.
<.> The development team's workspace.
<.> The name of the application that you want to deploy to the managed workspace.
<.> Optional: An unstructured key used for providing data for the managed Pipeline.
<.> Optional: Reference to the Pipeline to be executed by the release service.
<.> Optional: The name of the service account to use in the Pipeline to gain elevated privileges. It's used only if you have defined the `pipelineRef` value.
<.> The workspace to which the system deploys the application. This workspace is created by the Managed environment team (for example, your organization's SRE team)

. In the development workspace, apply the `ReleasePlan.yaml` file and add the resource to your cluster by running the following command:

+
[source,shell]
----
$ oc apply -f ReleasePlan.yaml -n dev
----

.*Verification*

. On the Trusted Application Pipeline console, select the *Release services* > *Release plan* tab.
. Review the Release plan object that you just added. Using the Release plan tab, you can update or delete the selected Release plan object.
