= Creating an override snapshot

In {ProductName}, the integration service provides users with the ability to reset their component's Global Candidate List to a desired state with a manually created `override` snapshot which can then be a candidate for further promotion (release) if it passes all integration tests.

You can xref:how-to-guides/testing_applications/proc_creating_override_snapshot.adoc[create an override snapshot] and provide a valid container image for a component to reset the component's Global Candidate List.

== Prerequisites
- You have CLI access to the specific OpenShift cluster. For information on obtaining CLI access, refer to  xref:../../getting-started/getting_started_in_cli.adoc[Getting started in CLI]
- You have an up-to-date kubectl binary. Alternatively, the `oc` binary is also compatible.
- You have an existing managed workspace such as `ws-sample`, an application such as `application-sample` and a component such as `component-sample`.

== Procedures
To create an `override` snapshot, complete the following steps:

. Identify the application and component that needs to be updated.
. In your preferred IDE, create an `override` snapshot in a `.yaml` file.
+
Example snapshot.yaml file::

+
[source]
----
apiVersion: appstudio.redhat.com/v1alpha1
kind: Snapshot
metadata:
  name: snapshot-sample
  namespace: ws-sample-tenant
  labels:
    test.appstudio.openshift.io/type: override <1>
spec:
  application: application-sample
  components:
    - name: component-sample <2>
      containerImage: quay.io/redhat-user-workloads/ws-sample-tenant/application-sample/component-sample@sha256:0db0a473a6abf5c15c424ab07cfbd5c40c06622fe648d4fe6a6b6abc224a0d0c <3>
      source: <4>
        git:
          revision: fa8b89274a61ef0f1c257b7a84c37aa2ec844109
----
<1> The label `test.appstudio.openshift.io/type: override` that indicates this is an `override` snapshot.
<2> The component name you will reset its Global Candidate List.
<3> The container image with valid digest you will reset the component <2> to.
<4> Optional. The component source containing the git revision.


. Save the .yaml file and add the snapshot.yaml by running the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f snapshot.yaml -n ws-sample-tenant
----
This command adds the `override` snapshot to your workspace and Integration service will processe the `override` snapshot and update the component `component-sample`'s `.Spec.ContainerImage` to `quay.io/redhat-user-workloads/ws-sample-tenant/application-sample/component-sample@sha256:0db0a473a6abf5c15c424ab07cfbd5c40c06622fe648d4fe6a6b6abc224a0d0c`

== Verification
After integration service processes the created `override` snapshot, you may verify snapshot and component by the following steps:

. Check snapshot `.Status.Conditions` by the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get snapshot snapshot-sample -n ws-sample-tenant -o yaml | yq  '.status.conditions.[] | select(.type =="AddedToGlobalCandidateList")'
lastTransitionTime: "2024-06-05T18:20:37Z"
message: The Snapshot's component was added to the global candidate list
reason: Added
status: "True"
type: AddedToGlobalCandidateList
----

. Browse to the component you are updating and select the **Component details** tab. The updated container image is shown under **Image** column. The updated source is shown under **Source code** column.

. Check component's `.Spec.ContainerImage` by the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get component component-sample -n ws-sample-tenant -o yaml | yq .spec.containerImage
quay.io/redhat-user-workloads/ws-sample-tenant/application-sample/component-sample@sha256:0db0a473a6abf5c15c424ab07cfbd5c40c06622fe648d4fe6a6b6abc224a0d0c
----

. Check component's `.Status.LastBuiltCommit` by the following command:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get component component-sample -n ws-sample-tenant -o yaml | yq .status.lastBuiltCommit
fa8b89274a61ef0f1c257b7a84c37aa2ec844109
