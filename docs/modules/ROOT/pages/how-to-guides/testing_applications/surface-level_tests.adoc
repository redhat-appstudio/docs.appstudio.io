= Surface-level tests
// :table-caption!: Uncomment this attribute if you want labels "Table N" to be removed from table titles.

== Scope
This document covers the surface-level tests (formerly known as "sanity tests") that {ProductName} runs as part of its component build pipeline. These surface-level tests automatically check all application images to ensure that they're up-to-date, correctly formatted, and protected from security vulnerabilities.

== Surface-level tests
The {ProductName} component build pipeline supports several types of tests, including surface-level tests. The surface-level tests used in {ProductName} are run in the form of https://tekton.dev/docs/pipelines/tasks/#overview[Tekton tasks]. The utility used for validating container information is https://www.conftest.dev/[Conftest]. Currently implemented surface-level tests are listed in the tables below.
