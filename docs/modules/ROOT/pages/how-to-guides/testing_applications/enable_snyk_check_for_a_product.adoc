= Enabling a Snyk task

[abstract]
The `sast-snyk-check` task uses the Snyk Code tool to perform static application security testing (SAST). 
Specifically, the Snyk check scans an application's source code for potential security vulnerabilities, 
including SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and code injection attack vulnerabilities.

> NOTE: You can run a Snyk task only if you have a Snyk token stored in a namespace secret. 
You should also include the name of your secret in the *snyk-secret* pipeline parameter.
