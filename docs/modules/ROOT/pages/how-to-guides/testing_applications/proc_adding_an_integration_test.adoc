= Adding an integration test

In {ProductName}, you can add integration tests to verify that the individual components of your application integrate correctly, forming a complete and functional application. {ProductName} runs these integration tests on the container images of components before their deployment.

.Prerequisites

* You have created an application in {ProductName}.

.Procedure
Complete the following steps in the {ProductName} console:

. Open an existing application and go to the *Integration tests* tab.
. Select *Add integration test*.
. In the *Integration test name* field, enter a name of your choosing.
. In the *GitHub URL* field, enter the URL of the GitHub repository that contains the test you want to use.
. Optional: If you want to use a branch, commit, or version other than the default, specify the branch name, commit SHA, or tag in the *Revisions* field
. In the *Path in repository* field, enter the path to the `.yaml` file that defines the test you want to use.
. Optional: If you need to deploy your application as part of the test, use the drop-down menu in the *Environment* field to select *development*. {ProductName} then deploys your application to a temporary clone of that environment during testing.
+
WARNING: Without specifying an Environment, an integration test can only do static testing. To make application endpoints available for testing, you must deploy your application to an ephemeral environment.
. Optional: To allow the integration tests to fail without impacting the deployment and release process of your application, you can choose to select *Mark as optional for release*.
+
NOTE: By default, all integration test scenarios are mandatory and must pass. A failing integration test marks the application snapshot as failed, preventing its deployment and release. However,  if you have selected *Mark as optional for release*, a failure in this test won't hinder the deployment and release of the application snapshot.
. Select *Add integration test*.
. Start a new build for any component you want to test.
.. For components using the default build pipeline, go to the *Components* tab, select the three dots next to the name of the component, and select *Start new build*.
.. For components with an upgraded build pipeline, make a commit to their GitHub repository.

.Verification
When the new build is finished:

. Go to the *Integration tests* tab and select the highlighted name of your test.
. Go to the *Pipeline runs* tab of that test and select the most recent run.
.  On the *Details* page, you can see if the test succeeded for that component. Navigate to the other tabs for more details.
