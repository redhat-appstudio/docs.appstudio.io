= Adding an integration test

link:https://docs.testing-farm.io/[Testing Farm] is a third-party test service that can be used as a test execution back-end for {ProductName}. This document guides you through an example of how to trigger Testing Farm tests from your {ProductName} *Integration tests*.

.Prerequisites

* You have created an application in {ProductName}.
* You have a Testing Farm API key, which can be acquired by following the link:https://docs.testing-farm.io/Testing%20Farm/0.1/onboarding.html[Testing Farm onboarding guide].
* You have have or are ready to create a git repository with link:https://fmf.readthedocs.io/[fmf] files suitable for use with the link:https://tmt.readthedocs.io/[tmt] testing tool. This is the testing technology used by Testing Farm under the hood. If you don't have a fmf tests already prepared, you can use our tmt link:https://github.com/ralphbean/tmt-hello-world[hello world repository].

.Procedure

You need to perform two major steps. Upload your Testing Farm API key, and register an *Integration test* to send requests to the Testing Farm API. Complete the following steps in the {ProductName} console:

.Procedure - Upload your Testing Farm API key

Follow similar instructions as in the xref:how-to-guides/configuring-builds/proc_creating-secrets-for-your-builds.adoc[Creating secrets for your builds] guide.

. In {ProductName}, from the left navigation menu, select **Secrets**.
. From the **Secrets** page, click **Add secret**.
. From the **Add secret** page, choose **Build**.
. Select secret type **Key/value secret**
. For **Secret name**, enter `testing-farm-secret`.
. Under **Key/value secret**, expand **Key/value 1**, then enter the key name `testing-farm-token`.
NOTE: Be sure that the secret name is `testing-farm-secret` and the key name is `testing-farm-token`. The link:https://github.com/ralphbean/testing-farm-tekton/blob/main/tasks/testing-farm.yaml[tekton task] expects the secret and key name to be named these strings exactly.
. For **Upload the file with value for your key or paste its contents**, paste the value of your token into the space under **Upload**.
. Optional: Under **Labels**, add a label to tag or provide more context for your secret.
. Click **Add secret**.

.Procedure - Registering the Integration Test

. Open an existing application and go to the *Integration tests* tab.
. Select *Add integration test*.
. In the *Integration test name* field, enter a name of your choosing to reflect your tests. The name `testing-farm` might be suitable.
. In the *GitHub URL* field, enter `https://github.com/ralphbean/testing-farm-tekton`, which is a git repository containing a tekton pipeline and task that can send requests to the Testing Farm API.
. In the *Path in repository* field, enter `pipelines/testing-farm.yaml`.
. Expand the *Parameters* field.
. Select *Add parameter*. For the *Name* field, enter `GIT_URL`. For the *Value* field, enter the url to the git repository that contains your *fmf* files. If you do not have any, try using our tmt link:https://github.com/ralphbean/tmt-hello-world[hello world repository] to try it out.
. Optional: Select *Add parameter*. For the *Name* field, enter `COMPOSE`. For the *Value* field, enter a valid Testing Farm compose identifier. Try `Fedora-39`.
. Optional: If you do not want the test to prevent the application from being deployed, then select *Mark as optional for release*.
. Select *Add integration test*.
. Start a new build for any component you want to test.
.. For components using the default build pipeline, go to the *Components* tab, select the three dots next to the name of the component, and select *Start new build*.
.. For components with an upgraded, custom build pipeline, make a commit to their GitHub repository.

.Verification
When the new build is finished:

. Go to the *Integration tests* tab and select the highlighted name of your test.
. Go to the *Pipeline runs* tab of that test and select the most recent run.
. You should be able to find the testing-farm URLs in the logs.
