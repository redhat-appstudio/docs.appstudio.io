= Retriggering Build Pipelines

Occasionally, your build pipeline may fail unexpectedly, necessitating a retrigger. For pull requests, this can be achieved by adding comments. For post-merge builds, retriggering can be done either through UI, or by using the API to add an annotation to your Component resource.

See also xref:how-to-guides/testing_applications/proc_retriggering_integration_tests.adoc[Retriggering integration tests].

== Retriggering a Pre-merge build on a pull request

.**Prerequisite**

- You have a build pipeline run on a pull request that has failed, and you want to re-run the build without pushing a new commit.

.**Procedure**

. Add a comment to the pull request with the text `/retest` to trigger a new build.

You should see the pipelinerun start executing in the UI and in the pull request.

NOTE: For additional options, refer to the link:https://pipelinesascode.com/docs/guide/running/#gitops-command-on-pull-or-merge-request[pipelinesascode documentation].

== Retriggering a Post-merge build from your main branch from GitHub

.**Prerequisite**

- You have already merged a pull request, but the subsequent build failed, prompting a need for retriggering.

.**Procedure**

. Navigate to the latest commit on your branch in the GitHub UI.
. Comment 
* `/test` , `/test <pipelinerun_name>`
* `/retest` , `/retest <pipelinerun_name>`  on the commit.

The pipeline run should resume in the *Activity* > *Pipeline runs* tab.

NOTE: This only works on the latest commit on the branch.

== Retriggering a Post-merge build from your main branch from the UI

.**Prerequisite**

- You have already merged a pull request, but the subsequent build failed, prompting a need for retriggering.

.**Procedure**

In the console, complete the following steps to retrigger the build pipeline:

. Navigate to the *Activity* > *Pipeline runs* tab.
. Identify the pipeline run that you want to retrigger.
. Select the three dots on the right side of the table.
. Select the *Rerun* action.

The pipeline run should resume in the *Activity* > *Pipeline runs* tab.

== Retriggering a Post-merge build from your main branch from the API

.**Prerequisite**

- You have already merged a pull request, but the subsequent build failed, prompting a need for retriggering.
- You have CLI access to {ProductName}. For information on obtaining CLI access, refer to  xref:../../getting-started/getting_started_in_cli.adoc[Getting started in CLI]

.**Procedure**

. Identify the *Component* whose pipeline requires rerun.
. Use the following command to annotate the *Component*, triggering a new build:
+
[source]
----
$ kubectl annotate components/[component name] build.appstudio.openshift.io/request=trigger-pac-build
----

. The build is re-triggered automatically.

+
[source]
----
$ tkn pipelinerun list
