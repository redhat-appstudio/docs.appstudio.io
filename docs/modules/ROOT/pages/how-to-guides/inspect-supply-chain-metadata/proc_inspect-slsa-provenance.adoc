= Downloading your SLSA provenance

Since we claim to meet SLSA Build Level 3, we have provided the following procedure for you to download the SLSA provenace that {ProductName} generates for each of your xref:../glossary/index.adoc#component[components], including both the attestation and its signature. 

.Prerequisites

* xref:../getting-started/getting_started_in_cli.adoc[Login] to {ProductName} in your CLI 
* link:https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/[Install] the `jq` command line utility 
* link:https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/installation/[Install] the `cosign` command line utility

.Procedure

First you need to get the image path for the component whose attestation you want to download. Then, you can use `cosign` to download the provenance. 

. List your components: 

+
[source]
--
oc get components
--

+
Example output:
+
[source]
--
NAME                         AGE   STATUS   REASON   TYPE
partner-catalog-build-ucmg   24d   True     OK       Updated
partner-catalog-ec-pz7b      18d   True     OK       Updated
--

. Choose a component and get its image path: 
+
[source]
--
oc get component <component name> -ojson | jq '.status.containerImage'
--

+
Example:
+
[source]
--
oc get component partner-catalog-build-ucmg -ojson | jq '.status.containerImage'
--

. For convenience, save the image path to a local variable.
+
Example:
+
[source]
--
IMAGE=quay.io/redhat-user-workloads/rhn-support-csears-tenant/demo-build/partner-catalog-build-ucmg@sha256:<output omitted>
--


. Use `cosign` to download the attestation, and use `jq` to put it in a human-readable format: 
+
[source]
--
cosign download attestation $IMAGE | jq '.payload|@base64d|fromjson'
--

+
Example output:
+
[source]
--
{
  "_type": "https://in-toto.io/Statement/v0.1",
  "predicateType": "https://slsa.dev/provenance/v0.2",
  "subject": [
    {
      "name": "quay.io/redhat-user-workloads/rhn-support-csears-tenant/demo-build/partner-catalog-build-ucmg",
      "digest": {
        "sha256": "<output omitted>"
      }
    }
  ],
  "predicate": {
    "builder": {
      "id": "https://tekton.dev/chains/v2"
    },
    "buildType": "tekton.dev/v1beta1/TaskRun",
    "invocation": {
<remaining output omitted>
--

. Use the same tools to download the attestation signature:

+
[source]
--
cosign download attestation $IMAGE | jq '.|keys'
--

+
Example output:
+
[source]
--
[
  "payload",
  "payloadType",
  "signatures"
]
[
  "payload",
  "payloadType",
  "signatures"
]
--

+
. (Optional) You can also print a high-level overview of the provenance-related artifacts that {ProductName} has created for a component: 

+
[source]
--
cosign tree $IMAGE
--
+
Example output:
+
[source]
--

* Learn about the SLSA framework and xref:../concepts/slsa/con_slsa-conformity.adoc[how {ProductName} meets the requirements of SLSA Build Level 3].
* Red Hat's Enterprise Contract (EC) is a powerful tool that you can also use to verify your SLSA provenance; visit link:https://enterprisecontract.dev/posts/introducing-the-enterprise-contract/[this page]  to learn how to use the EC CLI tool to verify your provenance. You will need the public key used by Tekton Chains, which is available as the *public-key* secret in the *openshift-pipelines* namespace and readable to all authenticated users.
