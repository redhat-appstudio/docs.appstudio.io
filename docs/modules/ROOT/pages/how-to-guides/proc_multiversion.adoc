= Managing multiple software versions

Software projects are often required to maintain multiple versions of the
software in parallel in order to support different users of the software with
different needs. As far as source code goes, the typical way to maintain
multiple versions is by using different Git branches. Using branches in
conjunction with Konflux can be somewhat tedious as a separate Component needs
to be defined for each branch and a separate Application needs to be defined
for each collection of components that need to be tested and released together.

The Konflux Project Controller seeks to streamline the process of managing
multiple versions by introducing the following objects and concepts:

- A *Project* is used to describe a major piece of software that can be worked
  on by multiple teams over an extended period of time. A project may contain
  one or more development streams.
- A *ProjectDevelopmentStream* indicates an independent stream of development.
  A *ProjectDevelopmentStream* can contain one or more *Applications* each
  containing one or more *Components*.
- As described above, starting a new development stream involves creating a
  large  amount of  *Application* and *Component* resources. The Project
  Controller helps to streamline that by allowing to create a
  *ProjectDevelopmentStreamTemplate* resource that specifies the resources to be
  created and allows for using variables to customize them. Using a template,
  many similar development streams can be created quickly.

== Using the Project Controller

In the sections below we will describe how to use the custom resources
supported by the Project Controller to manage multiple software versions and
generate Application and Component resources.

=== Before you begin

It's possible to have the Project Controller create all the Application and
Component resources you would need. It is recommended, however, for the first
time a particular repository is on-boarded, to do so manually via the Konflux
UI. That would help ensuring the right access credentials are in place as well
as that the Tekton Pipeline-as-Code files are committed to the repo.

When creating components the Project Controller assumes that:

- The default pipeline is not being used and that each branch in a component's
  repo contains the necessary Tekton Pipeline-as-Code files to build it.
- Any credentials required to access the component repo had already been
  configured as secrets in the Konflux workspace.

=== Creating a Project

Create a project resource by applying YAML like the following:

[source,yaml]
.project.yaml
----
apiVersion: projctl.konflux.dev/v1beta1
kind: Project
metadata:
  name: konflux-multibranch-sample
spec:
  displayName: "Multi-version demonstration sample project"
  description: |
    A sample project to demonstrate how to use the projects API.
----

=== Creating a ProjectDevelopmentStreamTemplate

To enable quickly creating multiple development streams, we must create a
template for them.

[source,yaml]
.template.yaml
----
apiVersion: projctl.konflux.dev/v1beta1
kind: ProjectDevelopmentStreamTemplate
metadata:
  name: konflux-multibranch-sample-template
spec:
  project: konflux-multibranch-sample
  variables:
  - name: version
    description: A version number for a new development stream
  - name: versionName
    description: A K8s-compliant name for the version
    defaultValue: "{{hyphenize .version}}"

  resources:
  - apiVersion: appstudio.redhat.com/v1alpha1
    kind: Application
    metadata:
      annotations:
        application.thumbnail: "5"
        finalizeCount: "0"
      finalizers:
      - spi.appstudio.redhat.com/remote-secrets
      - application.appstudio.redhat.com/finalizer
      name: "konflux-multibranch-sample-{{.versionName}}"
    spec:
      displayName: "konflux-multibranch-sample-{{.versionName}}"

  - apiVersion: appstudio.redhat.com/v1alpha1
    kind: Component
    metadata:
      annotations:
        applicationFailCounter: "0"
      finalizers:
      - test.appstudio.openshift.io/component
      - component.appstudio.redhat.com/finalizer
      - image-controller.appstudio.openshift.io/image-repository
      - image-registry-secret-sa-link.component.appstudio.openshift.io/finalizer
      - pac.component.appstudio.openshift.io/finalizer
      name: konflux-multibranch-sample-{{.versionName}}
    spec:
      application: "konflux-multibranch-sample-{{.versionName}}"
      componentName: "konflux-multibranch-sample-{{.versionName}}"
      source:
        git:
          context: ./
          dockerfileUrl: Dockerfile
          revision: "{{.version}}"
          url: https://github.com/ifireball/konflux-multibranch-sample.git
----

The *resources* section for the template may be created by looking at the YAML
for existing resources and copying it while removing generated and unnecessary
data and adding variable references where needed.

Here are specific examples for how to clean up and use the YAML for certain
resource kinds:

* For any kind of resource, the `namespace`, `creationTimestamp`, `generation`,
  `resourceVersion`, `uid` and `ownerReferences`, metadata fields should be
  removed as well as the `status` section.
* For *Application* resources the `metadata.name` and `spec.displayName` fields
  should contain variable references.
* For *Component* resources:
** The following annotations should be removed:
*** `build.appstudio.openshift.io/status`
*** `image.redhat.com/image`
** The `spec.containerImage` field should be removed.
** The following fields should probably contain variable references:
*** `spec.application`
*** `spec.componentName`
*** `source.git.revision`

Some notes about using template variables:

* You can use the https://pkg.go.dev/text/template[Go text/template] syntax to
  place template variable values into various resource attributes as well as
  variable default values.
* You can use the custom `hyphenize` template function to create a value
  suitable for use in resource names.
* It's advisable to quote strings that contain variable references and other
  template syntax elements to prevent the curly braces from being parsed as JSON
  embedded into YAML.

=== Creating a ProjectDevelopmentStream

Once the *Project* and *ProjectDevelopmentStreamTemplate* resources are in
place, we can create *ProjectDevelopmentStream* resources.

[source,yaml]
.devstream.yaml
----
apiVersion: projctl.konflux.dev/v1beta1
kind: ProjectDevelopmentStream
metadata:
  name: konflux-multibranch-sample-v1-0-0
spec:
  project: konflux-multibranch-sample
  template:
    name: konflux-multibranch-sample-template
    values:
    - name: version
      value: "v1.0.0"
----

Creating this *ProjectDevelopmentStream* resource will cause the resources
specified by the referenced *ProjectDevelopmentStreamTemplate* resource to get
created. Since we've used the `version` template variable in the
`spec.git.revision` field of the component resources, each component version
will use a different branch of the component repository.

=== Branching your component repositories

Beyond creating new Git branches for your components in order to maintain
different versions, you must also adjust the `.tekton/*.yaml` files within those
branches in order to make the pipelines run and target the right components.

In particular the following changes must be made each time a new branch is
created in each of the pipeline YAML files:

* The `pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/on-cel-expression` annotation should be
  adjusted to specify and filter by the right branch name. For example, for a
  pull request pipeline that resides in the `v1.0.0` branch the annotation value
  would be:
+
[source]
----
event == "pull_request" && target_branch == "v1.0.0"
----
+
For a push pipeline in the same branch the value would be:
+
[source]
----
event == "push" && target_branch == "v1.0.0"
----

* The `appstudio.openshift.io/application` and
  `appstudio.openshift.io/component` labels must be adjusted to specify the
  right Application and Component respectively. Failing to do this will cause
  builds of the pipeline to be associated with the wrong application or
  component.

== Known limitations

The following limitations exist in the current controller implementation and are
likely to be resolved in the future.

* Resource creation order is important. You must first create *Project*
  resources followed by *ProjectDevelopmentStreamTemplate* resources and only
  then *ProjectDevelopmentStream* resources.
* If a *ProjectDevelopmentStreamTemplate* is modified, resources that were
  already created using that template do not get updated unless either:
** The controller gets restarted
** The *ProjectDevelopmentStream* resource referring to the template is modified
* If a resource created by a template is modified, the configuration is not
  aligned back with the template unless either:
** The controller gets restarted
** The *ProjectDevelopmentStream* resource referring to the template is
      modified
* A *ProjectDevelopmentStream* that isn't referring a template may be modified
  to refer to a template. Similarly, the template *ProjectDevelopmentStream* is
  referring to may be changed. In both those cases, resources owned by the
  *ProjectDevelopmentStream* but not defined by the new template do not get
  deleted.
