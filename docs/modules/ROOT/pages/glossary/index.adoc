== Build Pipeline customization 
The ability to update and manage Build Pipelines for each component in an application. 

== Cluster
A Kubernetes deployment, which includes nodes that run containerized applications, and a control plane that manages the nodes.

== Commit 
A change to one or more files. In {ProductName}, commits that you make to a linked repository move through the pipeline and automatically get published.

== Component 
An image that {ProductName} builds from source code in a repository. One or more components that run together form an application.

== Conftest 
A utility for testing structured configuration data. Use Conftest to validate container information.

== Enterprise Contract (EC) 
A set of release policies that you apply to your managed environment. Use the EC to prevent the release of Supply chain Levels for Software Artifacts (SLSA) that are non-compliant. 

== Ephemeral environment
A temporary environment that executes each integration scenario. The system creates these environments dynamically on demand and then removes them after completing the build pipeline.

== Integration test 
A pipeline that you set up in GitHub. As you add components, it tests each one individually, and then tests the application as a whole.

== Integration testing: 
A process that uses Tekton tasks to support the setup and execution of dynamic application tests against container images.

== IntegrationTestScenario
A parameter that the Integration Service uses to test the application components.

== Java build service 
A group of utilities that accelerates build times, locates dependencies in final images, and meets product security requirements by managing the construction of Java dependencies. 

== Lifecycle run
The processes that automatically occur after a merge or pull request is resolved. These processes may include build and integration tests, as well as TaskRuns. 

== Managed environment 
An application release target. A separate Managed Environment team, such as an Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) team, manages the environment, which exists in an external workspace.

== Managed workspace 
A workspace that mirrors some details of an already existing workspace. Supporting teams can create a managed workspace to grant limited permissions to development teams in the production environment. 

== OSBS features 
The layered image build service, or OSBS (derived from OpenShift Build Service), is a tool for building layered images. With OSBS features, you can build base RHEL images, layered images, and the builder image itself.

== Persister
A component that moves the Pipeline output, which is all of the relevant PipelineRun information, to an external storage that is outside the cluster’s etcd database, after the system completes PipelineRun.

== Pipelines as Code
A practice that defines pipelines with source code in Git. Pipelines as Code is also the name of link:https://pipelinesascode.com[a subsystem] that executes those pipelines.

== Pipeline results 
Systems that retain the history and details of builds. 

== PipelineRun
A collection of TaskRuns that are arranged in a specific order of execution. A valid Pipeline is compliant with the customer’s Enterprise Contract.

== Pipeline service 
A managed service that securely runs Tekton Pipelines. It also stores the metadata and Pipeline logs that are related to an executed Pipeline in a separate database.

== Product security test 
A test that assesses the security of build inputs and outputs with vulnerability scanning, code scanning, image testing, and result reporting. It also identifies outdated images, applications, and build pipelines. 

== Pruner
A component that removes resources that are associated with the completed PipelineRuns. The system assigns resources, such as pods, to every PipelineRun. Without a pruner, these resources remain in the cluster indefinitely, even after the system completes the PipelineRun. 

== Release pipeline 
A pipeline that defines the process for validating snapshots against the Enterprise Contract. They also provide an array of release destinations other than GitOps deployments. 

== Security testing 
A process that determines if images meet security quality standards.

== Signature and provenance
Mechanisms that use Tekton chains to extract and store the metadata of the PipelineRuns, sign that metadata, and then store it in the image registry adjacent to the Component image.

== Snapshot 
A set of component and container images that specifies which components should be deployed with which container images. The system creates a snapshot when it finishes running a component's build pipeline. 

== Static environment 
A set of compute resources that you can use to develop, test, and stage your applications before you release them. You can share static environments across all applications in the workspace. 

== {ProductName} 
A platform to automate the process of building, testing, and deploying applications to the hybrid cloud. {ProductName} offers enterprise-grade security and customizable feature sets.   

== Supply chain Levels for Software Artifacts (SLSA) 
A link:https://slsa.dev/[security framework] that helps prevent tampering by securing the packages and infrastructure of customers’ projects.

== Task 
One or more steps that run container images. Each container image performs a piece of construction work.

== TaskRun 
A process that executes a Task on a cluster with inputs, outputs, and execution parameters. The system creates a TaskRun on its own or as a part of a PipelineRun for each task in a pipeline.

== Tekton 
A Knative-based framework for CI/CD pipelines. Tekton is decoupled which means that you can use one pipeline to deploy to any Kubernetes cluster across multiple hybrid cloud providers. Tekton stores everything that is related to a pipeline in the cluster, so you can use the cluster across multiple pipelines.

== Tekton chains 
A mechanism to secure the software supply chain by recording events in a user-defined pipeline.

== Workspace
A storage volume that a Task requires at runtime to receive input or provide output.
